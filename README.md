# Human-Pose-estimation-using-machine-learning-AICTE-Internship
Human pose estimation using machine learning is a fascinating field in computer vision that focuses on identifying and tracking the positions of human body joints (key points) in images or videos. This technique is widely used in applications such as augmented reality, animation, sports analytics, and healthcare.

Data Collection: Gather images or videos containing human figures.

Preprocessing: Use libraries like opencv-python-headless to preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).

Model Training: Train a deep learning model (e.g., using convolutional neural networks) to detect key points such as elbows, knees, and shoulders.

Inference: Use the trained model to predict key points in new images or videos.

Visualization: Use libraries like matplotlib and Pillow to visualize the detected poses.
